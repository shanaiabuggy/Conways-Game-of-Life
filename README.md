# Conways-Game-of-Life
This is my newly implemented GUI of Conway's Game of Life created using QT Creator!

Interactions:
-The 'Step' button allows you to advance the game 1 turn.

-The 'Play" button with advance the game automatically, advancing 1 turn every x seconds, where x is determined by the speed chosen via the speed slider.

-The 'Pause' button stops the game from playing automatially.

-Press the 'Reset' button to reset the game at any time.

Note:
Live cells are pink/yellow
Dead cells are white

There are four rules in Conway's Game of Life:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies. (underpopulation)
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors remains alive. (stable)
3. Any live cell with more than three neighbors dies. (overpopulation)
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell. (reproduction)

Special features:

~Cells within the grid that respawn on a turn via 'reproduction', will appear yellow.
~Check the 'Big grid' box to play on a grid 4x the initial area.
